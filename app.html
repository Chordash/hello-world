			<h2>Download the App, Delivery in Minutes</h2>
			<p>Getting started with CUber is a simple 3 step process</p>
			<ol>
			  <li>Search your phone's app store and download the CUber app</li>
			  <li>Sign up for a new account with some personal information and payment method</li>
			  <li>Tap the button to instantly request delivery of your new USB Tybe A to Type C cable to your current location</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The app boasts several additional features such as the ability to see the estimated time for delivery, the exact location of your delivery driver, direct line of communication with the driver, viewable order history, a driver rating system, and even Spotify&trade; integration so you can dictate what music your driver has to listen to. Much care and dedication has gone into developing this app to provide the best user experience possible. No matter the time or where you are, you are only a couple of taps away from a USB Type A to Type C cable.</p>
